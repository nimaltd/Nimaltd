# 👋 Hey, I'm Nima Askari  

🚀 **Electronic Engineer**  
I design modern libraries for embedded systems with clarity and reliability in mind.  
Programming and electronics are not only my profession, they are also my passion and a source of joy.  
I love turning complex electronics into **simple, reusable, and modern solutions** so developers can focus on building amazing projects instead of debugging the basics.
