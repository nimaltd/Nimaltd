# 👋 Hi, I'm Nima Askari

🚀 **Electronics Engineer & Embedded Systems Developer**  

I focus on building **simple, reliable, and reusable C libraries** for embedded systems — making development cleaner, faster, and easier to maintain.  
I enjoy bridging hardware and software, turning complex low-level details into efficient, developer-friendly solutions.

### ⚡ Focus Areas
- 🔧 **Embedded C Libraries** – modular and lightweight code for microcontrollers  
- 🖥 **System Design** – embedded architecture and firmware integration  
- 🔩 **Electronics & Prototyping** – circuit design, PCB layout, and debugging  
- 🛠 **Hardware-Software Integration** – connecting firmware with real hardware  
- 📦 **Reusable Code** – tools and libraries for faster development

### 👨‍💻 Experience & Highlights
🏆 **2003** – *Third Place*, National Skills Competition of Electronic Engineering (Iran)  

With over 20 years in the field, I’ve worked across:  
- Embedded programming  
- Electronics design & production  
- Hardware testing and assembly  

You can find my open-source libraries here — practical tools made to support embedded engineers.
