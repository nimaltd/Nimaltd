# 👋 Hey, I'm Nima Askari  

🚀 **Electronic Engineer & Embedded Systems Developer**  

I specialize in designing **modern, lightweight, and reliable C libraries** for embedded systems.  
My goal is to make **embedded development simpler and cleaner**, so engineers can focus on building products, not reinventing the wheel.  

Programming and electronics are more than just my career—they are my passion.  
I enjoy transforming **low-level complexity** into **reusable, well-structured, and developer-friendly libraries**.  

### ⚡ Focus Areas  
- 🔧 **Embedded C Libraries** – clean, reusable, and efficient code for microcontrollers.  
- 📦 **Code Reusability** – libraries designed for portability and scalability.  
- 🛠 **Problem-Solving** – turning complex hardware challenges into simple software solutions.  
- 📚 **Knowledge Sharing** – writing code that is as clear as it is powerful.  

### 👨‍💻 Achievements & Experience  

🏆 **2003** – Third Place, *National Skills Competition of Electronic Engineering* (Iran).  

With **20+ years in electronics**, I’ve worked across:  
- 🖥 **Embedded System Programming**  
- 🔩 **Electronics Design & Manufacturing**  
- 🔌 **Repair & Assembly Engineering**  

From hands-on circuit design to embedded software architecture, my journey has always been about **clarity, precision, and reliability**.
