👋 Hi, I'm Nima Askari

🚀 Electronics Engineer & Embedded Systems Developer

I focus on designing simple, reliable, and reusable C libraries for embedded systems — tools that make development smoother and more maintainable.

I enjoy working close to hardware, where code meets circuits, and where small design choices make a big difference in reliability and performance.

⚡ Focus Areas
- Embedded C Libraries – modular, lightweight code for microcontrollers
- Embedded System Design – system architecture and firmware integration
- Electronics Design & Prototyping – circuit design, PCB layout, and debugging
- Hardware-Software Integration – connecting firmware with real-world hardware
- Code Reusability – building libraries and components that simplify future projects

👨‍💻 Experience & Highlights

🏆 2003 – Third Place, National Skills Competition of Electronic Engineering (Iran)

With over two decades in electronics, my work has covered:
- Embedded system programming
- Electronics design and production
- Hardware testing, repair, and assembly

You can find some of my open-source libraries here — practical tools built to support embedded engineers in their daily work.
